# ☕️ Coffee Sales Data Insights & Forecasting (Power BI)

A portfolio case study analyzing The Grind Co.’s coffee retail sales data with Power BI.                  
The goal: mine mid-year sales data for top products, store performance, and hourly/AOV patterns, then forecast the second half to inform staffing, inventory, and targets.

## 📌 Problem Statement  
A three-store coffee chain in Florida wants a mid-year (H1 2023) review to answer:

1. Which categories / product types / SKUs drive revenue?
2. When do stores sell the most (by hour & day, and how does AOV behave)?
3. What is our full-year 2023 outlook at current pace vs recent momentum?
4. Where are the opportunities to lift AOV, staffing efficiency, and hours?

## 📂 Dataset  

The dataset is a **single table** (`Coffee_sales_data`) with **transaction-level coffee sales for 2023**, containing fields such as:

* **Transaction** → `transaction_id`, `transaction_date`, `transaction_time`, `transaction_qty`, `unit_price`
* **Store** → `store_id`, `store_location` *(Orlando, Tampa, Miami)*
* **Product** → `product_id`, `product_category`, `product_type`, `product_detail`

Schema has been reshaped using **Power Query / DAX** (references only, source table load disabled):

* **Fact table** → `Coffee_Sales_Fact` 
* **Dimensions** → `Stores_Dim` (deduplicated: `store_id`, `store_location`) and `Products_Dim` (deduplicated: `product_id`, `product_category`, `product_type`, `product_detail`)
* **Date spine** → full 2023 date table for H1 slicing & FY forecasting (Month, Month Short, Day Name, etc.)
* **Type & format cleanup** → normalized date formats, enforced data types (Date, Time, Whole Number, Decimal)
